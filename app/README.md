# Opentrons Desktop App

[![JavaScript Style Guide][style-guide-badge]][style-guide]

[Download][] | [Support][]

## overview

The Opentrons desktop application lets you use and configure your [Opentrons personal pipetting robot][robots]. This directory contains the application's UI source code. If you're looking for support or to download the app, please click one of the links above.

This desktop application is built with [Electron][]. You can find the Electron wrapper code in the [`app-shell`](../app-shell) directory.

## developing

To get started: clone the Opentrons/opentrons repository, set up your computer for development as specified in the [contributing guide][contributing-guide-setup], and then:

```shell
# change into the cloned directory
cd opentrons
# prerequisite: install dependencies as specified in project setup
make setup
# launch the dev server / electron app in dev mode
make -C app dev
```

At this point, the Electron app will be running with [HMR][] and various Chrome devtools enabled. The app and dev server look for the following environment variables (defaults set in Makefile):

| variable             | default      | description                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`           | `production` | Environment: production, development, or test |
| `PORT`               | `8090`       | Development server port                       |
| `OT_APP_INTERCOM_ID` | unset        | Sets the Intercom application ID              |
| `OT_APP_MIXPANEL_ID` | unset        | Sets the Mixpanel application ID              |

**Note:** you may want to be running the Opentrons API in a different terminal while developing the app. Please see [the contributing guide][contributing-guide-running-the-api] for API specific instructions.

## stack and structure

The UI stack is built using:

- [React][]
- [Redux][]
- [CSS modules][css-modules]
- [Babel][]
- [Webpack][]

Some important directories:

- `app/src` â€” Client-side React app run in Electron's [renderer process][electron-renderer]
- API clients (see [`api/opentrons/server`][api-server-source])
  - `app/src/rpc` - RPC API client
  - `app/src/robot-api` - HTTP API client
- `app/webpack` - Webpack configuration helpers

## copy management

We use [i18next](https://www.i18next.com) for copy management and internationalization.

When adding any translatable copy strings, follow these conventions:

Choose a continuous chunk of target copy that composes a translatable unit. This should be all text in a paragraph, or sentence, but might only be 1 word (e.g. within a button).

1. Does the new copy belong within an existing translations namespace (e.g. 'robot_connection', 'robot_calibration', 'shared'...)?

   - if yes, add a new key-value pair to that file. The value should be the english copy string. The key should be a snake case string that describes this copy's purpose within the namespace.
   - if no, create a new namespace for this area of the application's functionality. Add a file titled `[namespace].json` to `app/src/assets/localization/en/`. Add a new key-value pair to that file. The value should be the english copy string. The key should be a snake case string that describes this copy's purpose within the namespace. Include the namespace in the i18n instance initialization function at `app/src/i18n.js` under the `ns` key of the options passed to the init fn (`{...ns: [ 'new_namespace' ]...}`). Import and export the new `[namespace].json` file from the manifest file at `app/src/assets/localization/en/index.js`

2. Does the copy include dynamic internal values, or embedded markup (e.g. "Hello {{user}}, click `<a>`here`</a>`.")?

   - if yes, use the `Trans` component from `react-i18next` docs [here](https://react.i18next.com/latest/trans-component)
   - if no, use `useTranslation` hook to retrieve the `t` function. docs [here](https://react.i18next.com/latest/usetranslation-hook)

**Note**: If a component utilizes both the `Trans` component and the `useTranslation` hook, be sure to pass the `t` function in as the `t` prop of the `Trans` component, that way the same namespace resolution order is maintained for all translation keys within that component.

## testing

Tests for the App are run from the top-level along with all other JS project tests.

- `make test-js` - Run all JavaScript tests

Test tasks can also be run with the following arguments:

| arg   | default | description             | example                             |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| watch | false   | Run tests in watch mode | `$ make test-unit watch=true`       |
| cover | !watch  | Calculate code coverage | `$ make test watch=true cover=true` |

For end-to-end tests using Cypress, ensure that the Docker emulator is running and calibrated before attempting to execute the following.
See DOCKER.md in root directory for instructions on running the Docker emulator.

Incorporating this into the test automation is currently in progress.

```shell
# To launch the app in an external browser mode.
make -C app dev OT_APP_UI__EXTERNAL_BROWSER=1
# Run Cypress end-to-end tests in terminal without any GUI.
make test-e2e
# Open the Cypress test runner GUI to visually see the test suites run.
# Won't automatically start running tests. You will need to click on the test suites to run them.
make cypress-visual
```

## building

If you'd like to build the Electron desktop app, see the [app shell's build instructions][app-shell-readme-build].

The UI bundle can be built by itself with:

```shell
# default target is "clean dist"
make -C app
# build without cleaning
make -C app dist
```

The UI build process looks for the following environment variables:

| variable   | default      | description                                         |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Build environment: production, development, or test |
| `ANALYZER` | unset        | Launches the [bundle analyzer][bundle-analyzer]     |

For example, if you wanted to analyze the production JS bundle:

```shell
ANALYZER=1 make -C app
```
